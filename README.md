# WeatherAppUsingJs
A weather app using HTML, CSS, and JS is a web application that displays current weather conditions and forecasts for a specific location. The app typically requires the user to input their location, either by entering a city name, and the app then retrieves the weather data from a weather API and displays it in an easily readable format.

The HTML code for the app would contain the basic structure of the web page, including the header, main content area, and footer. The CSS code would be used to style the page and make it visually appealing, including adding colors, fonts, and layout.

The JavaScript code would be used to fetch data from the weather API and display it on the page. The app may also include additional features, such as the ability to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units, or display weather alerts and warnings.

Overall, a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JS is a useful and practical project that can be easily customized and expanded upon to include additional features and functionality.
