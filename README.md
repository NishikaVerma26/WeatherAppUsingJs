# WeatherAppUsingJs
A weather app using HTML, CSS, and JS is a web application that displays current weather conditions and forecasts for a specific location. The app typically requires the user to input their location, either by entering a city name, and the app then retrieves the weather data from a weather API and displays it in an easily readable format.
